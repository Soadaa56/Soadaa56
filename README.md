Hello, my name is Kevin Duffy and I'm an aspiring web developer currently working my way through [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com) (TOP).

After the foundations section of TOP, which taught HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I had 2 choices between Ruby on Rails and NodeJS. I figured I was already on the path less traveled (Self-taught web developer) and choose the path least traveled again; and started learning Ruby on Rails and fell in love with it immeditatly. Ruby is such a beautiful language and amazing as an introduction into programming. 

On the other hand, Rails was just as easy as an introduction into web development. I don't have experience with other full-stack frameworks, but I really enjoyed the "opinionated" way Rails does things as it gave me direction with solving problems and creating sites. It was also quite interesting watching this documentry about Rails and gaining insight into the founder David Hansson. It was quite interesting to know it took him multiple attempts to learn how to program.

In the meantime I have also started reading Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz. It's a lot to take in but I thought I should be working on proper OOD paradigms with my classes instead of spaghetti code.
